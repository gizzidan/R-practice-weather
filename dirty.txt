1. First, I read the files into R. I used read.csv for the csv files and read.csv2 for the .txt file that was separated with ';'

2. I went through each city file and corrected what was wrong. I primarily used summary() and hist() to get an idea of any issues.
   

ABC: Converted the temperature from C to F, removed any text in the Wind Speed column, removed any outliers in the Temperature and Wind Speed columns.
    
KLM: Reordered the data columns correctly (doesn't really matter, but I did it anyway), removed any text in the Wind Speed column, removed any outliers in the Temperature and Wind Speed columns.
    
PQR: Reordered the data columns correctly, converted Wind Speed from KPH to MPH, removed any outliers in the Temperature and Wind Speed columns.
    
XYZ: Removed any text from the Wind Speed column, removed any outliers in the Temperature and Wind Speed columns.


3. Find mean Wind Speed for March, 2006 for each city.

4. Find mean Temperature for 2006 for each city.
